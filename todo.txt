Idea is folowing:

1. os2server parses CONFIG.SYS and build environment. Stataments like
   BASEDEF, DEVICE and IFS must be ignored because drivers moved to
   Neutral Personality
2. After config.sys parsing finished os2server must execute task pointed
   by PROTSHELL environment variable.
3. os2server must provide interface for all or most of kernel depended
   OS/2 API functions. Functions, which can be implemented on personality
   level must be implemented on personality level. Direct calls from OS/2
   Personality to servers not allowed. Only possible things is calling to
   os2server which will forward calls to real servers.
