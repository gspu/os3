An OS/2 application that has been loaded into memory and prepared for execution is
called a process. A process is the code, data, and other resources of an application,
such as file handles, semaphores, pipes, queues, and so on. The OS/2 operating system
considers every application it loads to be a process.

Information about a process is kept in a read/write area of the process address space,
called the Process Information Block (PIB). The operating system creates and maintains
a PIB for every process in the system.

An application can access the PIB of a specific process using DosGetInfoBlocks.

A thread is a dispatchable unit of executable code that consists of  set of instructions,
related CPU register values, and a stack. Every process has at least one thread and can
have many threads running at the same time. The application runs when the operating
system gives control to a thread in a process. A thread is the basic unit of execution.

Information about a thread is kept in a read/write area of the process address space,
called the Thread Information Block (TIB). The operating system creates and maintains
a TIB for every thread in the system.

An application can access the TIB of a specific thread using DosGetInfoBlocks.

Note:  The fields of this data structure should not be modified unless you are switching
       stacks, in which case only the tib_pstack and tib_pstacklimit should changed.
